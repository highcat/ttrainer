Typewriter trainer written with ncurses.

* Gets a file as a parameter - and then you'll have to type it.
* Supports 'C-j' and 'C-m' keybindings like in Emacs.
* Counts current and average typing speed
* Saves your achievements to ~/ttrain.log


Working on Linux, looks like working on Win32.
Don't get scared - this code is from my early student years.
